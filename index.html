        <h1>The Complete Guide to HAZECO Bills</h1>
        <p>Understanding Tariffs, Taxes, and Online Services in the Hazara Division</p>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>If you live in <strong>Abbottabad, Mansehra, Haripur,</strong> or the surrounding districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, your electricity is supplied by the Hazara Electric Supply Company (HAZECO). While electricity is a necessity, understanding the monthly bill can feel like decoding a secret language.</p>
        
        <p>From Fuel Price Adjustments (FPA) to the concept of "Protected Consumers," the billing structure in Pakistan has evolved significantly in recent years. This comprehensive guide is designed to help residents of the Hazara region understand their consumption, reduce their costs, and utilize digital services effectively.</p>

        <h2>1. HAZECO Operational Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>HAZECO was carved out of PESCO to ensure better grid management for the Hazara region. It serves a diverse geographical area ranging from the industrial hubs of Haripur to the mountainous terrains of Kohistan.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Abbottabad Circle:</strong> Covers Abbottabad city and surrounding hill stations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mansehra Circle:</strong> Covers Mansehra, Battagram, and Torghar.</li>
            <li><strong>Haripur Circle:</strong> Focuses on the industrial zones and Hattar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Decoding the Taxes on Your Bill</h2>
        <p>Have you ever noticed that your bill amount is significantly higher than the cost of electricity you actually used? This is due to government taxes and surcharges. Here is a breakdown of the common terms found on a HAZECO bill:</p>

        <ul class="tax-list">
            <li>
                <span class="tax-title">FPA (Fuel Price Adjustment)</span>
                This is the difference between the estimated fuel cost and the actual fuel cost of power generation. It is usually added 2 months in arrears. If oil prices spike globally, your FPA increases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="tax-title">TR Surcharge (Tariff Rationalization)</span>
                This is the difference between the NEPRA-determined tariff and the Government of Pakistan's notified tariff. It is essentially a subsidy adjustment.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="tax-title">FC Surcharge (Financing Cost)</span>
                A charge collected to pay off the debt servicing of Power Holding Private Limited. It is currently set at 43 paisa per unit.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="tax-title">QTR Tariff Adj / DMA</span>
                Quarterly Tariff Adjustment. This is applied every three months to adjust for capacity charges and transmission losses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="tax-title">TV Fee</span>
                A standard Rs. 35 charge specifically for the Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Protected vs. Unprotected Consumers</h2>
        <p>In the current billing structure, the most critical factor for domestic users is the "Protected" status. This status offers significantly lower rates per unit.</p>
        
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>How to stay "Protected":</h3>
            <p>To maintain protected status, your electricity consumption must remain <strong>below 200 units</strong> for 6 consecutive months. Once you exceed 200 units in a month, you may be moved to the "Unprotected" category, where the base tariff is much higher.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>4. Peak vs. Off-Peak Hours (For TOU Meters)</h2>
        <p>If you have a 3-phase digital meter or a Time-of-Use (TOU) meter installed, you are charged differently depending on the time of day. Electricity is most expensive during "Peak Hours."</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Season</th>
                    <th>Peak Hours (Expensive)</th>
                    <th>Off-Peak Hours (Cheaper)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>December to February</td>
                    <td>5:00 PM to 9:00 PM</td>
                    <td>Remaining 20 hours</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>March to May</td>
                    <td>6:00 PM to 10:00 PM</td>
                    <td>Remaining 20 hours</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>June to August</td>
                    <td>7:00 PM to 11:00 PM</td>
                    <td>Remaining 20 hours</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>September to November</td>
                    <td>6:00 PM to 10:00 PM</td>
                    <td>Remaining 20 hours</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><em>Note: Avoiding heavy appliances (AC, Iron, Water Pump) during peak hours can reduce your bill by up to 25%.</em></p>
